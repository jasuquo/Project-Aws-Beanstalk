# Project-Aws-Beanstalk
### Deploying a high-availability WordPress website with an external Amazon RDS database to Elastic Beanstalk

In this project, you will learn how to deploy and host WordPress, an open-source blogging tool and content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL. You will implement an architecture to host WordPress for a production workload with minimal management responsibilities required from you. To accomplish this, you will use AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). Once you upload the WordPress files, Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. Amazon RDS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity, while managing time-consuming database administration tasks for you.
